## üöÄ From Blueprint to Browser: My Daily Coding Ritual

Welcome to my repository for a specific project from my ongoing **"Lunch Break Coding Challenge."** This initiative is all about consistent, focused practice, fitting coding into a busy life ‚Äì no matter where I am or what tools I'm using!

My unique rule for this challenge: **No AI assistance.** It's just me, Google, and the hands-on process of problem-solving.

### The Setup

* **IDE:** GitHub Codespaces (accessed directly on my iPad)
* **Workflow:** Daily 30-minute sessions during my lunch break.
* **Version Control:** Practicing `git commit` and other commands directly through the Codespaces terminal.
* **Challenge Source:** Weekly challenges suggested by Claude, providing structured learning paths.

## Project: Dave Gray's React Challenge - Episode 10 (Color Display)

This specific project is a direct result of tackling **Episode 10 of Dave Gray's React Challenge**. You can find the video for the challenge here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0) (Please replace with the actual link to Dave Gray's Episode 10 video).

It served as an excellent practical exercise to solidify core React concepts.

### ‚ú® Features

This simple, yet effective, web component demonstrates:

* **Dynamic Styling:** Updates the background color of a display area in real-time.
* **Input Handling:** Captures user input efficiently using React state.
* **Responsive Display:** Ensures the component behaves well across different screen sizes.
* **Controlled Components:** Illustrates how React manages form elements using state.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **React:** For building the user interface.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** The core logic.
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure of the component.
* **CSS3:** Styling and dynamic visual updates.

## üí° My Learning Journey & Reflection

As a professional currently in construction, transitioning into front-end development, this daily ritual is invaluable. It helps me bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. My background has instilled a **field-proven precision** that I believe translates directly into **engineering robust web solutions** ‚Äì focusing on strong foundations, meticulous execution, and practical, real-world utility.

Balancing a full-time job, a 4-month-old, and life in general makes dedicated coding time a challenge. But I'm committed to finding time whenever and wherever I can, pushing forward with a "hands on the keyboard" approach until this passion becomes my primary job.
